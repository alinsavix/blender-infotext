# Blender Info Text

This is a simple module that displays a bunch of information inside
the 3D View window, in a somewhat configurable manner. Most of this
code has been stolen blatantly from the wonderful Speedflow
(<https://blendermarket.com/products/speedflow>), whose features
I've found I don't really need... but I wanted this feature, and
I wanted to be able to add additional features to it without having
to keep a close eye on Speedflow development (lest it break under
my nose). And, well, here we are. Much appreciation to the Speedflow
developers for all their hard work!
