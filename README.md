# Blender Infotext

This is a simple module that displays a bunch of information inside
the 3D View window, in a slightly configurable manner.

This idea (and much of the original code) was blatantly stolen from
from the Speedflow (<https://blendermarket.com/products/speedflow>),
whose features I've found I don't really need -- but I loved the
overlays! The original Speedflow code has been hacked almost beyond
recognizability, but you can still see bits of the original if you
look.

This addon should definitely be considered beta quality at best, but
it works well for me! I will *gladly* fix any problems found if they are
reported (via Github issue, ideally, but I'll also take email, text
message, smoke signals...).

If you get no text in the 3D viewport, something is probably crashing --
check the Blender console, and if it's dumping out a bunch of errors,
open an issue with the error text. I'll probably make it better about
catching its own errors in the future.

I hope someone finds this addon useful!
